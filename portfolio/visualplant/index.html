					In the early '00s I was recruited by a magazine publisher to become the Design Director for their Internet division.
					They had just acquired the most popular video site on the Web and wanted to "integrate it."
					I worked with their editorial team to redesign the 
					site and create a new content management workflow specifically for video publishing. We relaunched in 
					60 days and turned it profitable 
					in the first year by catering to business users. I became intimately acquainted with the unique challenges of putting video
					on the Web.

				<div class="text-cols body-text">
					
					Most businesses had high-speed 
					Internet in 2002, 
					but Cable and DSL penetration for consumers was sparse.
					This combined with a lack of file standards and
					competing browser plugins made the consumer experience for video really bad.
					No single company could solve all the problems alone. Lack of content and poor quality 
					yielded low viewership causing publishers to misread
					the problem as one of disinterest which in turn discouraged technologists from tackling the space.	
					But like text and audio before, video would inevitably come of age.
					Someone needed to take  
					the initiative to innovate the publishing tools, 
					to create a "Wordpress for video" at the opportune moment when the market was ready for it.

					By 2006 video codecs like Sorenson had matured enough to achieve decent quality and reduced file size. Macromedia's Flash 
					plug-in provided the right blend of browser independence and player interactivity. High bandwidth penetration for 
					consumers finally surpassed 50%. 
					
					I gambled Web video was finally poised to take off. Perhaps, it was wishful thinking and a little luck.
					I left my full-time job to bootstrap a video-as-a-service (VAAS) platform. My former employer became 
					my first client, and my new company, Visualplant, was profitable in the first year.

					Every company follows a unique path, but those with any success share at least one thing in common: they launch their product fast. 
					It was less than 30 days from my first design comp to when I debuted Visualplant beta 
					to hundreds of thousands of industry insiders and influential users.
					<br /><br />
					How did I build one of the first ever scalable Web video services in a month? The honest answer is I didn't. 
					I created a video player that consumed manually-encoded files from a network of CDNs.
					Ironically, I put most of my 
					first efforts into designing a player when players already cluttered the market. Why?
					
					Because I needed to generate excitement on the look of the future, and I didn't have the time or money to build the plumbing just 
					yet. I knew CMSs were not sexy, but large quantities of engaging, high-quality video served instantly <i>would raise eyebrows</i>. I showed my potential client a newly-designed, custom-branded, fullscreen video player with auto-playback playlists
					and offered to serve their biggest viewing 
					event of the year for free. They loved the interface, the quality and the no risk proposal, and they took me up on it.

					The demo earned me the clout to request 
					a follow-up sales meeting. I presented with the tact, "if you like the video player, then get a load of the platform 
					behind the scenes."
					I arrived with design mockups of the dashboard and 
					<span style="font-style:italic">convinced my first client to sign an agreement to pay for a platform that did not yet exist</span>.
		
					While the agreement was hashed out by our legal counsel, I assembled a small, tech team from my network to begin engineering.

					With the income to develop and the traction to attract more clients, we did both. 
					Releasing new features almost weekly, within three months we had developed a multi-tier, dynamically scalable 
					platform with two primary interfaces: a web services API
					for developers and a WYSIWYG templating engine for non-technical publishers.
					I designed each tool on the micro-level, writing
					pseudo-code to describe every user and system interaction,
					and I illustrated the meta-view allowing my developers
					to see the forest through the trees and for my clients to appreciate what they were
					paying for.

					Founding Visualplant taught me that building a company involves much more than polishing 
					a user interface or perfecting code.
					
					Developing a product for a market that previously did not exist demands taking huge risks and making do-or-die choices nearly every day. Those begin with deciding the right time to deliver the right product to receptive users. With that as a back-drop product design takes on new and deep meaning. I used every skill in my toolbox to make something greater than "make a living." I exploited the elements of design to inspire belief in a mission. Design became more than visual and interactive; it descended to the dictionary definition: "[de¬∑sign] - to form or conceive in the mind; contrive; plan; to intend for a definite purpose." I had to ask not only what to design, but <i>how</i> to design it and how to get from point A to Z. The team, clients, press and users all needed to be engaged immediately, continually and entirely. 
					
					<br /><br />
					
					In the past I focused on the minutiae of my work from 
					set-go, but I learned to invest perfectionism in the long term vision that gets realized progressively over months 
					and years. The experience informed my method to become a collaboration between me and everyone who 
					touches the product. That does <i>not</i> mean "design by committee." 
					Instead, I first articulate a vision of what to build, then develop it in phases observing how teammates and users respond to each release. 
					Course adjustments and sometimes pivots are necessary to design something great. After all, nothing is great until it proves itself in action.
