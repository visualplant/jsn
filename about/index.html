					 &mdash;among the world's most experienced Web User Experience designers. For 15 years [this] has worked with businesses to design enticing, useful and memorable apps for music, video, news, finance, travel and social networking.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					With a background in English, music and graphic design, [this] discovered the Web in 1996. Within weeks of picking up HTML he found himself working with a ninja tech team on a multi-tier Java Beans Web app with dozens of permutations customized for a myriad of user demographics serving over 10 million music consumers. He got a little excited when his boss referred to him as the "UI Lead." 
					
					<br /><br />
					
					A couple years later [this] tried Napster, and shortly afterward, he worked on it, helping Shawn Fanning's crew keep user experience top-of-mind while integrating digital rights
					 into peer-to-peer music file sharing. He went on to design other seminal music apps, including for Ruckus, BMG Entertainment and Sony Music.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					When Web 1.0 bombed and 80% of the workforce changed careers, [this] kept active in the field. He became Advertising Age's first Web Design Director, later founded two startups  &mdash; a video platform and a Web 3.0 social networking product &mdash; and learned the lesson of spreading himself way too thin. 
					
					<br /><br />
					
					Shortly after, [this] learned to write about himself in the 3rd person.
