					Over the years I progressed from working with big teams in large companies 
					to working with smaller teams in early-stage ventures. I found a 
					clarity of purpose and efficiency of implementation in small teams that often gets crushed by
					beaurocracy in larger entities. Too much money and too many cooks in the kitchen can
					kill a good idea.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					I decided that I wanted to start my own venture keeping it small and agile. So,
					in 2006 I started Visualplant. Here's a synopsis.

			In 2002 I was recruited by a magazine publisher to become the Design Director for their Internet division.
			They had just acquired the most popular video site on the Web and wanted to "integrate it."
			I worked with their editorial team to redesign the 
			site and create a new content management workflow specifically for video publishing. We relaunched in 
			60 days and turned it profitable 
			in the first year by catering to business users. I became intimately acquainted with the unique challenges of putting video
			on the Web.

		<div class="text-head">Problem</div>
	
		<div class="text-cols body-text">
			
			Most businesses had high-speed 
			Internet in 2002, 
			but Cable and DSL penetration for consumers was sparse.
			This combined with a lack of file standards and
			competing browser plugins made the consumer experience for video lousy.
			No single company could solve all the problems alone. Lack of content and poor quality 
			yielded low viewership causing publishers to misread
			the problem as one of disinterest which in turn discouraged technologists from tackling the space.	
			But like text and audio before, video would inevitably come of age.
			Someone needed to take  
			the initiative to innovate the publishing tools, 
			to create a "Wordpress for video" at the opportune moment when the market was ready for it.

		<div class="text-cols body-text">
			By 2006 video codecs like Sorenson had matured enough to achieve decent quality and reduced file size. Macromedia's Flash 
			plug-in provided the right blend of browser independence and player interactivity. High bandwidth penetration for 
			consumers finally surpassed 50%. 
			
			I gambled Web video was finally poised to take off. Perhaps, it was wishful thinking and a little luck.
			I left my full-time job to bootstrap a video-as-a-service (VAAS) platform. My former employer became 
			my first client, and my new company, Visualplant, was profitable in the first year.

		<div class="text-head">Approach</div>
	
		<div class="text-cols body-text">
			Every product follows a unique path, but those with any success share at least one thing in common: they launch fast. 
			It was less than 30 days from my first design comp to when I launched Visualplant 
			to over 1 million users in its beta debut.
			<br /><br />
			How did I build one of the first ever scalable Web video services in a month? The honest answer is I didn't. 
			I created a video player that consumed manually-encoded files.
			Ironically, I put most of my 
			first efforts into designing a player when players already cluttered the market. Why?
			
			Because I needed to excite my potential clients on the look of the future, and I didn't have the time or money to build the plumbing just 
			yet. I showed them a newly-designed, custom-branded, fullscreen video player with auto-playback playlists
			and offered to serve their biggest viewing 
			event of the year for free. They loved the interface, the quality and the no risk proposal, so they took me up on it.

			The demo earned me the clout to request 
			a follow-up sales meeting. I presented with the tact, "if you like the video player, then get a load of the platform 
			behind the scenes."
			I came with design mockups of the dashboard and 
			<span style="font-style:italic">convinced my first client to sign an agreement to pay for a platform that did not yet exist</span>.

			While the agreement was in legal, I assembled a small team from my network to begin engineering.
			The most critical tools, including the uploader/encoder, title manager and impression reporting came first.

			With the income to develop and the traction to attract more clients, we did both. 
			Releasing new features almost weekly, within three months we had developed a multi-tier, dynamically scalable 
			platform with two primary interfaces: a web services API
			for developers and a WYSIWYG templating engine for non-technical publishers.
			I designed each tool on the micro-level, writing
			pseudo-code to describe every user and system interaction,
			and I diagrammed a meta-view of the platform allowing my programmers
			to see the forest through the trees and for my clients to appreciate what they were
			paying for.

		<div class="text-head">Lesson</div>
	
		<div class="text-cols body-text">
			Creating Visualplant taught me more than ever that design is an iterative task. Much more than polishing 
			a user interface or perfecting code for a final release, it is choosing the right time to pursue the right product 
			and using design 
			to inspire belief in a mission. The team, investors, clients, press and users 
			all need to be engaged immediately and continually. 
			
			In the past I focused on the minutiae of product design from 
			set-go, but I learned to invest perfectionism in the long term vision that gets realized over many months 
			and often years. Today my design method encompasses a collaboration between me and everyone who 
			touches the product. That does <i>not</i> mean "design by committee." 
			Rather, I create 
			a vision of what to build, design in phases and observe how users respond to each release. 
			Course adjustments and sometimes pivots are essential to designing something great. Because nothing can 
			be called great until it proves itself in action.
