					Sony Music is one of the 3 "majors" managing hundreds of artists and thousands of songs. Every day the company grants and revokes sales rights to distribution partners around the world. Tracking this activity internally was archaic, requiring business users to request custom database reports from internal IT staff. There was a dire need to improve visibility into this process in order to fix problems <i>and</i> identify opportunities to accelerate business. I was contracted by the VP of Sony Music Information Services and Technology (IS&amp;T) to design a visualization app to do just that.
					
					<!--I helped design and develop a real-time data visualization to track the digital distribution of the label's music files. The app allows business users to navigate with out click between global activity, regional and partner. 
					
					tracks approximately 100,000 transactions per hour to over 300 global partners like Apple, Spotify and Rdio. This Web-based app was built into a multi-screen physical installation at Sony Headquarters.-->

						I began by researching the full range and type of activity moving through the label's distribution channels. I pulled database reports showing between 50,000 and 150,000 transactions per hour encompassing a myriad of transaction types and attributes. I documented and validated my findings with a Sony product manager. I gathered a list of additional requirements that included zooming into transactions by product and user-configurable watchlists.

						Simultaneously, I engaged the technical project manager on a discussion of back-end requirements and visualization libraries.
						The new app would need to use the legacy Oracle database without disturbing existing processes. The client would need to be Web-accessible, run 24-7 and display to multiple viewport sizes including a large, multi-screen installation at the company headquarters. Although this desktop app did not need to be functional on mobile devices, I urged consideration for mobile accessibility in future iterations.

I worked closely with the technical project manager to determine the requirements for interfacing with Sony's legacy Oracle database, and presented a number of options for the front-end.-->

					The next step was to produce designs to meet all the requirements. Real time transactions were represented by white symbols falling from above, each with a distinct size and shape to represent transaction type, subtly evoking the metaphor of precipitation. A color spectrum ranging from yellow to red indicated volume. Transactions fell into their appropriate buckets by region and partner. Counters incremented totals for each bucket.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					The default view reflected all current activity <i>and</i> provided a breakdown by region. Only two clicks were required to zoom into partner activity (region > partner). Watchlists were created and edited via a modular pane with a search utility to tag specific products. Distinct icons were superimposed on each bucket when transactions for a relevant product occurred. An "events view" displayed details on every transaction in each user watchlist. Finally, all activity could be paused and resumed without loss of data using simple playback controls. 
					
					<br /><br />
					
					The first designs were wireframes and static graphics representing different states of the application. I presented these as hi-def screens to discuss pros and cons and progress toward a phase 1 product design.

					During implementation, I worked daily and closely with the technical project manager, client developer and database engineer to answer questions, guide, unit test and ensure design specs were adhered to. Early proof-of-concepts and planning helped avoid empty design promises, and on this project every feature proposed was delivered. Working closely with the team built a rapport that helped to design successive iterations.
