Dreaded wireframes are often the visual introduction to a product and though they are essential for planning, they can be a real downer, doing injustice to a potentially good idea, even resulting in its dismissal. It's critical to get positive reinforcement from users out of the gate and generate excitement among the team, but let's accept that it's not realistic to produce static hi-def designs to portray dozens of screens and the many mutations a product can undergo in the concept stage.

Instead, try this approach: create storyboards that look like b/w comic strips, perhaps a specific one like The Simpson's. If Homer becomes your primary user, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Ned, Mr. Burns, Smithers and the cast of characters represent different players or personas.

This completely changes how people view wireframes. Stiff, technical blueprints get replaced with approachable, amusing user stories which ease inhibitions, engage team participation, encourage creativity and express a â€˜work in progress'. Allow the team to scribble their own ideas for changes directly on your printed mockups.

Art Spiegelman exploited the same underlying principle in his book series "Maus: A Survivor's Tale". By telling the story of the holocaust in a comic strip, readers were freed to consider the holocaust in a brand new light. If comics can cut through the horror of mass-murder, they surely can cut through the doldrums of wireframes.
