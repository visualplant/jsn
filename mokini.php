					College campuses are a hotbed of diverse interest groups with academic and social agendas. 
					Communication between people and groups is loose and de-centralized. 

					I conducted my own research at Stanford University and found that students and faculty use a myriad of modalities 
					to broadcast one-to-many messages:
					Web forums, Facebook, Twitter and even old-school mailing lists. 
					Such real-time communication is spontaneous and intimate, but sadly the information is massively redundant,
					missed by many intended recipients, unsearchable by the community and largely ephemeral. 
					I teamed up with two Machine Learning software developers to address 
					this problem on campus. Since college tends to be a dense microcosm of society,
					Stanford was a good place to prove our beta.

					We began by creating a simple Web tool for users to add trusted sources to exclusive interest groups. If necessary, we 
					would use the tool ourselves to seed groups with sources.
					Most importantly, users did not need to change their communication habits; they could continue to use their usual 
					modalities to broadcast and 
					receive. But now, with a growing number of sources in-tow and proxied to our platform, <i>we could capture the broadcast content</i>.

					Our application evaluated the sources in depth. It used a secret sauce of reputation factors 
					and assigned a variable trust index to each.
					It then processed content from the sources and performed topic modeling and ranking.
					Finally, it de-duped, prioritized and presented the news as hot topics and announcements &mdash; 
					all in near real-time. The results were stunningly helpful.
