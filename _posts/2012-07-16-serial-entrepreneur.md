If you refer to yourself as a "serial entrepreneur" …

… then, you are bragging that you start companies just for the game, to add another notch in your belt, because you're a "visionary" and too "high-level" to follow through on what you started. Replace "start companies" with "date people" and "kill people" in the last sentence and you can be a serial monogamist and serial killer too.

It's a foolish tact. Would you open a first date with: "I will date you briefly and then bail" or "I will take you home and strangle you"? At least pretend your goal is to commit. Create just one thing that matters.

If you fail a few times, so be it. Success is elusive. But let someone else call you a serial entrepreneur. And if they do, be a little insulted.
