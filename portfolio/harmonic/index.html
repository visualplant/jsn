					I joined <a href="http://www.harmonicinc.com" target="_blank">this video tech company</a> to help them transition their legacy hardware products to modern, cloud-native software, and in the process, solve a growing problem. They had over 50 different product user interfaces in their portfolio with non-intuitive workflows that mostly looked terrible. The UIs were inconsistent with each other, bound by no ecosystem and often overlapped in functionality&mdash;the cumulative effect of many product initiatives and acquisitions with various, questionable design standards.

				<div class="text-cols body-text">
					In the past, my employer's Product Managers would take every customer-requested feature and have it added to their products, exposing the same feature to thousands of other, unexpecting users. This approach resulted in "death by a thousand cuts" and major code-bloat which hampered agility. In effect, the lack of a good process led to this dysfunctional dynamic, and it needed to change before the product design could improve. So, one of my first jobs was to evangelize a design-driven software process and change minds at my employer. I presented my approach to internal stake holders to get us started on the right foot.

					In a redesign it's counterproductive to fixate on the legacy product. Instead, I take a step back to look at the market and users to gain a deep understanding of context. Good design flows from good discovery and research. It's the first, essential step in the process.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					My cyclical discovery for VOS consisted of a combination of internal interviews with SMEs (subject matter experts), competitor analysis, customer visits and analysis of legacy usage data. 	
					
					<br /><br />
					
					For customer visits, I arrived onsite with a simple plan: First, I asked a handful of broad questions, and listened attentively. Second, I passively observed users in their work environments. My direct exposure revealed something quite different from previous assumptions. The users were paralyzed by a maze of complexity, and the disorganized UI was scaring customers away to the competition.

					With a plethora of useful research documented, I collaborated with my Product Managers to interpret it and formulate a product design plan. Naturally, this involved a lot of trial-and-error, so we quickly presented ideas on the white-board and captured them to a photo stream for subsequent review and discussion. Then, we filtered the best from the rest, and reached consensus to proceed.</div>

					It's exciting see ideas take form in high fidelity screens, but particularly on a platform of such ambitious scope, there's more than aesthetics happening in the design stage. It begins with a well-crafted interaction style guide, including behaviors comprised of custom components (Javascript) and look-and-feel elements comprised of stylistic classes (CSS) derived from the company brand. The result should support usability standards, incorporate the thought and planning invested in discovery, express the company's personality and ultimately provide continuity throughout every interaction in a large-scale, multi-app platform. Good design, like good coding, is object-oriented which means we don't need to reinvent the wheel every time a similar user interaction is needed on subsequent use cases.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					My style guide delivered clear documentation <i>and</i> client-tested templates with classes customized specifically for the current needs and growth expectations of our product. All front-end deliverables were responsive and mobile-first.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					The assets were published to an internal Web portal (UXHub) with styles, components, patterns and a semi-functional prototype delivered in a version-controlled repository. The code contained brief, helpful comments with references to Confluence docs, and finally, epic JIRA tickets assigned to Scrum masters for task-delegation to individual developers. It made for a well-organized hand-off to the Engineering group to execute back-end development, as well as detailing acceptance criteria for later quality assurance testing.

					A powerful, simple and delightful user experience framed with a beautiful user interface is academic until developed to work in the real world, to perform at scale and be extensible. To that end, some of my first and most important users to please are the developers. My deliverables to them should not only be clear and organized, but also excite them to work toward the design goal, because everyone wants to give their best to a product that makes sense and looks awesome. 
					<br /><br />
					On VOS my UI production team delivered significant front-end code as described in the Design stage which freed back-end programmers to focus on the heavy-lifting of micro-service engineering, API development and integration. During this stage, I was available on demand to answer questions, clarify direction, provide detailed pseudo-logic and offer guidance on corner cases.

					Production deployment can be fulfilling and nerve-racking. But despite conventional wisdom&mdash;that a designer's role is done at this moment&mdash;the design has only completed its first cycle. In fact, this is the time to discover again, learn how the product performs in the real world and repeat the process. This cycle is as important as the seminal design itself. Informed, continuous deployment is a hallmark of a successful product.
					<br /><br />
					With VOS I evaluated the live product from two categorical sources: <b>usage data</b> and <b>customer feedback</b>.
					<br /><br />
					For <b>usage data</b> we embedded two, 3rd party tools. The first captured impressions, clicks and workflow funnels. The second was user-elective and captured screen shots of individual users at work in the UI.
					<br /><br />								
					 <b>Customer feedback</b> came from several sources, including Sales Reps, trade shows, arranged meetings and a Community Forum. 
					 <br /><br />	
					 The goal was never to solicit feature requests, but rather observe, listen and interpret customer goals into features, and ultimately incorporate them into a product roadmap. That way we, the architects, would design the product for our customers and not the other way around&mdash;a win-win where business goals and customer needs aligned.
