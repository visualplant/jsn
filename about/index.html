						I founded <a href="/portfolio/visualplant/">Visualplant</a> &mdash; a platform for
						encoding, managing and serving video on the Internet.
						
						<br /><br />
						
						Before that I was the Director of Product Design for <a href="/portfolio/">Advertising Age</a> &mdash; regarded as "the
						bible of advertising."
						
						<br /><br />
						
						Back in the day I helped <a href="/portfolio/">Napster</a> &mdash; the seminal peer-to-peer music service &mdash; integrate digital rights management and relaunch a legal version of their product.
						
						<br /><br />
						
						In between and along the way I've designed more than a dozen Web and Mobile products for clients such as <a href="/portfolio/">Sony Music</a>, <a href="/portfolio/">Sabre Travel Network</a> and
						a heaping handful of <a href="/portfolio/">startups</a>. I like to consider myself a startup designer with the experience and maturity to collaborate within complex teams.
						
						<br /><br />
						
						Currently, I do 
						contract Web Design for <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. See my <a href="/portfolio/">work portfolio</a> for more.

						<strong>The first thing</strong> I am is a writer. Every aspect of User Experience design &mdash; from product design to user interface design to technical design, coding and of course copy &mdash; derives from written communication. Words are <i>the</i> primary medium to organize information, express ideas and provide direction. The best education in this field is one that demands lots of practice reading, writing and convincing. My English Major / Philosophy Minor are foundations that define me.

						<strong>The second thing</strong> I am is endlessly curious about every art form &mdash; from graphic design to architecture to industrial design to music to programming to business, branding and marketing. User Experience is a gestalt of every one of these disciplines, and I've studied them all either formally or informally. Such a diverse background can run the risk of dabbling, but I'm careful not to. I immerse myself in one thing at a time with several years of devotion (or at least many months of obsession) and incorporate each into my own perspective. With any luck, that yields uniquely good intuition. Continual self-education is my research, and I draw upon intuition to influence every new project.

					<div class="text-cols body-text">
					
						<strong>The third thing</strong> I am is experienced &mdash; more experienced than virtually any living digital designer. I've witnessed failures first-hand, and with those visceral lessons, I've internalized many paths to avoid. While the less-experienced require more time-consuming user-testing and data to prove wrong ideas, I instantly steer clear of hidden pitfalls and gain a huge competitive advantage. Product viability and speed to market are the two most important aspects of success, and experience is the key that unlocks them  &mdash; experience both leading and building ambitious product designs.

					<div class="text-cols body-text">
					
						<strong>Finally</strong>, I am hands-on. All the communication and theory is academic unless I can build. In any good work there is little separation between idea and execution. I focus on front-end production &mdash; HTML/CSS &mdash; but I'm not afraid of PHP, ROR and databases &mdash; just careful to remain focused on my chosen expertise and not overstep my bounds within a team. I'm anchored to Adobe CS and responsive Web design and also love to test out new open source frameworks that can provide a competitive edge. I'm perfectly willing to participate in lean, agile methodologies in a team as long as we agree that people precede process, not the reverse. I'm well aware of first mover advantage and that the faster we release a great working product, the more likely it will win an audience, and, in business terms, command or create a new market.

					<!--A Web Designer without communication skills is just toying around with widgets and showing off chops. Before I begin to design or develop I focus on describing the purpose in English and make sure the entire team understands the logic behind it.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					I create through imagination, organization, documentation, execution and iteration.-->
