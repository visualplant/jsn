The practice of User Experience Design has been bandied about in recent years to the point where most people donâ€™t know what it means and confuse it with many other disciplines. UX design comprises every single one of the areas below working together as one to form a whole greater than the sum of its parts, and as software and Web sites grow more complex, the number of elements that comprise them grow as well. Claiming you are a UX Design specialist is no excuse for not knowing every singe one of these disciplines in great detail. Not to be virtuosic in each currently (that is impossible), but to have been thoroughly immersed in each at one time in your life, yes.
