						 &mdash;among the world's most experienced interaction designers. For 15 years Jason has worked with businesses to design enticing, useful and memorable apps for music, video, news, finance, travel and social networking.
						
						<br /><br />
						
						With a background in music, audio engineering and graphic design, Jason discovered the Web in 1996. Within weeks of picking up HTML he found himself working with a ninja tech team on a multi-tier Java Beans Web app with dozens of permutations customized for a myriad of user demographics serving over 10 million music consumers. He got a little excited when his boss referred to him as the "UI Lead." 
						
						<br /><br />
						
						A couple years later Jason tried Napster, and shortly afterward, he worked on it, helping Shawn Fanning's crew keep user experience top-of-mind while integrating digital rights
						 into peer-to-peer music file sharing. He went on to design other seminal music apps, including for Ruckus, BMG Entertainment and Sony Music.
						
						<br /><br />
						
						When Web 1.0 dot-bombed and 80% of the workforce changed careers, Jason kept working in the field. He became Advertising Age's first Web Design Director, later founded two startups  &mdash; a video platform and a Web 3.0 social networking product &mdash; and learned the lesson of spreading himself way too thin. 
						
						<br /><br />
						
						Shortly after, Jason learned to write about himself in the 3rd person.
