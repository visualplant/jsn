				"Alias" is an alias for Jason Schmidt &mdash; among the world's most experienced Web Designers.
				He began in the field in 1996 when Mosaic had just morphed to become Netscape. 
				
				<br /><br />
				
				Already competent in Photoshop, he learned HTML in two weeks and scored a job doing it for 
				BMG Music Service. He went from
				coding static files to working on a multi-tier Java Beans Web app with dozens of permutations 
				customized for a myriad of user demographics. He got a little excited when his boss referred to him
				as the "UI Lead." 
				
				<br /><br />
				
				A couple years later Jason tried Napster, and 
				shortly afterward, he worked on it, helping Shawn Fanning and crew integrate DRM into ver 2.
				
				<br /><br />
				
				When Web 1.0 dot-bombed and 80% of the workforce changed careers, Jason never stopped working 
				in the field. He went on to found two tech startups and learned the lesson of spreading himself 
				too thin.
				
				<br /><br />
				
				Years later, Jason learned to write about himself in the 3rd person.
