						<strong>The first thing</strong> I am is a writer. Every aspect of User Experience &mdash; from information architecture to visual design to copy to technical design and code &mdash; derives from written communication. Text is the primary medium to organize information, express ideas and provide direction. The best education in this field is one that demands lots of practice reading, writing and convincing, so my English Major / Philosophy Minor are foundations that define me.

						<strong>The second thing</strong> I am is endlessly curious about every art form &mdash; from Graphic Design to Architecture to Industrial Design to Music to Programming to Business, Branding and Marketing. User Experience is a gestalt of every one of those disciplines, and I've studied them all either formally or informally. Such a diverse background can run the risk of dabbling... I don't dabble. I study one thing at a time and incorporate each into my own signature perspective which yields good intuition. Constant self-education is my research, and I draw upon that intuition to influence every new project.

						<strong>The third thing</strong> I am is experienced &mdash; more experienced than virtually any living Web Designer. I've seen the failures first-hand, so I know paths to avoid. Where the less-experienced go blindly and require time-consuming user-testing and data collection to prove wrong ideas, I steer clear of pitfalls and gain a competitive advantage. Product viability and speed to market are the two most important aspects of success, and experience is the key that unlocks them.

						<strong>Finally</strong>, I am hands-on. My communication, perspective and experience set me apart, but its all for naught unless I can build. I focus on front-end execution &mdash; HTML/CSS/Javascript &mdash; but I'm not afraid of PHP, ROR and databases, and I love to test out new open source frameworks that can realized a competitive edge. I'm perfectly willing to participate in lean, agile methodologies to maximize production efficiency in a team as long as we agree that people precede process. The faster we release a great working product, the more likely it
						  wins an audience, and, in business terms, commands or creates a new market.

					<!--A Web Designer without communication skills is just toying around with widgets and showing off chops. Before I begin to design or develop I focus on describing the purpose in English and make sure the entire team understands the logic behind it.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					I create through imagination, organization, documentation, execution and iteration.-->
