The practice of User Experience design has been bandied about in recent years to the point where most people donâ€™t know what it means and confuse it with many other disciplines. UX design comprises every single one of the areas below working together as one to form a whole greater than the sum of its parts.

As software and Web sites grow more complex, the number of elements that comprise them grow as well in a continuing evolution. Claiming you are a UX designer should not be an excuse for ignorance about architectural design, coding, production and the many technical aspects of implementation that affect a final product. Neither should a programmer think s/he can ignore the theoretical, sociological, psychological and aesthetic aspects of UX because they are just "academic." At some point, every UX designer should have studied every single one of these disciplines or at least obsessed over them. While it's impossible to be virtuosic in each all at once, it is necessary to have been-there-and-done-that to make sound judgements in this field. The final challenge comes in synthesizing each area into a complete understanding, developing a perspective and making fast decisions that account for the critical concerns of each in a single product.
