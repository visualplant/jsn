I've heard design referred to as "problem solving." Is this description helpful?

Problem solving assumes that the start point is a problem and the end point is a solution to that problem. If the designer is to solve problems, then s/he waits for a problem to come along (or a boss or client to assign a problem) which then becomes her task to solve. The task, of course, represents a point of pain – an issue that needs to be fixed. So, the designer goes to work doing research, looks very closely at the problem, studies it through a microscope, making the problem appear nice and big. S/he shows this blown-up problem back to her manager who agrees this is, indeed, a biggie. Then, the designer goes to work on the problem. If the problem is, for instance, that users are abandoning a registration process on step 2, then the designer focuses on the problem: step 2. Something must be wrong there.

But what if the problem is that the product's value proposition doesn't speak to users, so they never become convinced enough to complete the registration process? What if the entire brand isn't trustworthy or emotionally connecting? In other words, maybe the problem is just a symptom. To focus on the problem dictates the solution. The problem comes to control the problem-solver.

To cite a scenario from the physical world: if our problem is that we need to cross the ocean, what happens if we start by viewing water as something in the way, as a problem? Of course, we cannot swim across the ocean, so do we drain the ocean? We are fixating on water as a problem. Why not look beyond the problem and instead use it to our advantage. Invent a new tool: the sail boat. Sail over the ocean. Invent a plane. Fly over that ocean. In the process create a new industry or two.

Problems get solved by pursuing a vision. JFK didn't fixate myopically on solving the problem of unemployment in the 1960s, he said, "Ask not what your country can do for you…" and "…we will put a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth". Steve Jobs didn't attempt to solve design problems within existing markets, he said, "Think Different." Amazingly, we forgot about problems we had with unemployment and flip phones, because we became focused on creating new things in new economies.

So, "design is problem solving" seems to me reactive, unhelpful and even detrimental. Perhaps a more proactive approach is to say: "Problem solving is design".
