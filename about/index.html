						In between and along the way I've designed more than a dozen Web and mobile apps for clients such as <a href="/portfolio/sony-music-pulse/">Sony Music</a>, <a href="/portfolio/traveal/">Sabre Travel Network</a> and
						a heaping handful of <a href="/portfolio/">startups</a>.<!-- At is a "startup designer" with the experience and maturity to collaborate within multi-departmental organizations.-->
						
						<br /><br />
						
						I'm hands-on, and I have a knack for attracting and motivating designers and UI dev resources to produce their best work for a mission bigger than themselves. I push myself and my teams to deliver stellar user experience, easy for users to learn, powerful enough to matter, and craft it to beautiful, pixel perfection in the stages of a continually advancing product roadmap.	
									
						<br /><br />
						
						In my spare time I play with bicycles, guitars, food, furniture, and ideas on how to navigate the coming singularity.

						<strong>The first thing</strong> I am is a writer. Every aspect of User Experience design &mdash; from product design to user interface design to technical design, coding and of course copy &mdash; derives from written communication. Words are <i>the</i> primary medium to organize information, express ideas and provide direction. The best education in this field is one that demands lots of practice reading, writing and convincing. My English Major / Philosophy Minor are foundations that define me. 
					
					</div>

					<div class="section-divider">&nbsp;</div>

					<div class="text-cols body-text">
			
						<strong>The second thing</strong> I am is endlessly curious about every art form &mdash; from graphic design to architecture to industrial design to music to programming to business, branding and marketing. User Experience is a gestalt of every one of these disciplines, and I've studied them all either formally or informally. Such a diverse background can run the risk of dabbling, but I'm careful not to. I immerse myself in one thing at a time with several years of devotion (or at least many months of obsession) and incorporate each into my own perspective. With any luck, that yields uniquely good intuition. Continual self-education is my research, and I draw upon intuition to influence every new project. 
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="section-divider">&nbsp;</div>
	
					<div class="text-cols body-text">
					
						<strong>The third thing</strong> I am is experienced &mdash; more experienced than virtually any living digital designer. I've witnessed failures first-hand, and with those visceral lessons, I've internalized many paths to avoid. While the less-experienced require more time-consuming user-testing and data to prove wrong ideas, I instantly steer clear of hidden pitfalls and gain a huge competitive advantage. Product viability and speed to market are the two most important aspects of success, and experience is the key that unlocks them  &mdash; experience both leading and building ambitious product designs.

					<div class="section-divider">&nbsp;</div>
					
					<div class="text-cols body-text">
					
						<strong>Finally</strong>, I am hands-on. All the communication and theory is academic unless I can build. In any good work there is little separation between idea and execution. I focus on front-end production &mdash; HTML/CSS &mdash; but I'm not afraid of PHP, ROR and databases &mdash; just careful to remain focused on my chosen expertise and not overstep my bounds within a team. I'm anchored to Adobe CS and responsive Web design and also love to test out new open source frameworks that can provide a competitive edge. I'm perfectly willing to participate in lean, agile methodologies in a team as long as we agree that people precede process, not the reverse. I'm well aware of first mover advantage and that the faster we release a great working product, the more likely it will win an audience, and, in business terms, command or create a new market.

					<!--A Web Designer without communication skills is just toying around with widgets and showing off chops. Before I begin to design or develop I focus on describing the purpose in English and make sure the entire team understands the logic behind it.
