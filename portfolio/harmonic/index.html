					Sabre Travel Network, best-known as the parent company of Travelocity.com, hired me to help their
					Mobile Strategy Group design a leisure travel mobile app. 
					
					The goal was to repurpose the company's travel inventory and 
					transaction API, to highlight transitory hotel deals, promote the hotel venues and make in-app reservations a breeze. 
					Sabre's Director of Mobile Strategy, provided impeccable direction 
					to catalyze creativity &mdash; simple, clear slides illustrating the product concept and top-level user

					I joined <a href="http://www.harmonicinc.com" target="_blank">this video tech company</a> to help them solve what they perceived to be a straight-forward problem. They had over 50 different products in their portfolio with unintuitive, unappealing user interfaces. The UIs were inconsistent with each other, but often overlapped in functionality&mdash;the cumulative effect of many product initiatives and acquisitions with various, questionable design standards. 
					  Not surprisingly, their customers sounded a chorus of complaints.

					In a redesign it's counterproductive to fixate on the legacy product. Instead, I begin by looking deeper&mdash;at the market and users&mdash;to formulate a design strategy with workflows and aesthetics driven by purpose. It’s amazing how naturally a design execution can flow from a thorough understanding of the problem rooted in agile process.

					My employer's products exposed dozens of cryptic fields and features which, for the most part when I asked, they defended by saying, "it's what the customers demenaded.” I asked myself, how did this occur? Every time a user asked for a feature, did the Product Managers have it added unquestioningly, further exposing it to other customers as well? I needed exposure to the users to find out.
					<br /><br />
					I arranged for onsite customer visits and arrived with a simple plan: First, I asked a handful of broad questions, and then listened attentively. Second, I observed users in their work environments. My direct exposure revealed something quite different from what I heard internally. The overwhelming majority complained of too many features and a maze of complexity. Customers’ solutions to these problems had often been to use the API to develop their own custom UIs as a workaround to the dangers of my employer's, costing them considerable development and human resources.

					For Traveal I began by sketching the concept of a limited time offer by placing an animated, signature countdown timer anchored in the header of 
					every browse screen &mdash; a friendly, looming reminder that the deals were transitory.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					Sabre has a lot of hotel partners comprising tons inventory, and the temptation was to offer all of it at once. 
					When asked, users inevitably say they want more of everything, so why not give it to them? 
					Because too many options are paralyzing, and overwhelming 
					choice leads to fatigue and inaction. Instead, I proposed that we limit display to 8 current deals 
					from different cities &mdash;
					enough for variety but not too much to absorb in a glance. A map view would provide for 
					browsing by location.

					After several iterations of sketches, presentations, note-taking and corrections, we reduced the features and screens to the bare

					With the specs and screenflow defined I could shift focus to the aesthetics of the UI. I kept it organized
					and familiar with an IOS-style grid, rounded corners and subtle depth, layering price-tag icons atop 
					hotel photos. I proposed red for the background hue for a few reasons: 
					First, red reflects urgency &mdash; in this case the urgency to act before a deal is gone. Second, blended red hues
					feel luxurious evoking the elegance of the hotel accommodations. Third, red is Sabre's corporate color (duh!). 
					
					While the color could become overbearing in an app where users spend a lot of time,
					we wanted Traveal users to purchase quickly and exit. And when they didn't, the intensity of the interface
					was memorable &mdash; leaving a poignant mind-print and an impulsion to return.

					From the outset I always design for the medium(s) and usually develop a semi-functional prototype to depict key workflows. This step often involves research and customization of open source Javascript components for use in my prototype,  including CSS. R&amp;D during design helps developers repurpose code to use in client engineering, saving significant time and reducing potential gaps between design and final product. With Traveal I was a proponent of building 
					a multi-platform Web app. 
					A single codebase of Javascript, HTML and CSS 
					could be repurposed for
					any mobile platform, served to a Web browser and/or compiled to fast-performing native apps for
					
					 iOS, Android™, Windows® Phone, Blackberry® 5/6/7, webOS and Symbian™.
					 
					 The PhoneGap
					API allows for access to all device functions required in this app, including geolocation.
