			After founding <a href="/portfolio/visualplant/">Visualplant</a>, I wanted to join forces with co-founders for my next 
			venture.
			
			<br /><br />
			
			At a networking event I met two students finishing up Master's degrees 
			in the MBA and Machine Learning programs at Stanford University. Together we debated ideas to pursue and presented to
			angel investors. We got accepted to a venture fellowship program sponsored by Lightspeed Venture Partners who
			provided us with funding and work space adjacent to their Sandhill headquarters. Here are the highlights.

			College campuses are a dense microcosm of society. Diverse interest groups
			vie for attention and struggle to get their messages heard.
			
			In general, it's a great place to study how information flows and
			find opportunities to improve it.
			
			<br /><br />
			
			My co-founders and I conducted research at Stanford University and found that students and faculty use a myriad of modalities 
			to broadcast one-to-many messages:
			Web forums, Facebook, Twitter and to a great degree, old-school (pardon the pun) mailing lists. 
			Such real-time communication is spontaneous and intimate, but sadly the messages are either massively redundant or
			missed by many intended recipients and unsearchable. 
			
			I teamed up with a Machine Learning software developer to address 
			this problem. Stanford was a perfect place to conduct a pilot.

			How do you convince people to change the way they communicate? Offer better communication tools. 
			But if no one uses the tools, then they have no reach and <i>the tools are useless...</i>
			Therein lies the problem of the cold start. So, we began from a premise: don't expect users to change their
			habits.
			
			<br /><br />
			
			We first created a simple Web-based input to kickstart our data store with RSS feeds, Twitter accounts
			and email lists. We would promote the tool to students, but initially we used it 
			ourselves to curate a collection of trusted sources, carefully seeking permission from the publishers when necessary.
			Users did not need to change their communication habits; they could continue to use their usual 
			modalities to broadcast and 
			receive. But now, with the sources and content proxied to our platform,
			we began to capture the ephemeral chatter of exclusive interest groups.

			Once captured, our application evaluated the sources in depth. It tracked multiple reputation factors 
			and assigned a variable trust index to each.
			It then processed content from the sources and performed categorization, topic-modeling and ranking.
			Finally, it de-duped, prioritized and presented the content as trending topics and announcements &mdash; 
			all in near real-time. The results were stunningly helpful.
