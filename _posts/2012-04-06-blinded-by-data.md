Today's product design jargon makes frequent use of the term "data-driven". Our decisions on what to design and build must come from data to be justified as sound. Otherwise, we'd be relying on vague intuition. Never a good thing.

Of course, this analogy derives from computers. Computers acquire, process and re-output data like we humans breath, eat, read and interact with one another. If we treat life experience like data and correctly interpret it, our difficult decisions get reduced to neat logical equations.

I love analogies, but this one is ironic. In applying the term data to our minds, we are modeling ourselves after tools that we humans first invented ~50 years ago to accelerate repetitive tasks. Computers were designed by us to serve us. So, isn't it odd to suggest we should mimic our subservient machines and adopt the simplified language we invented for their development? The language of computers is a reduced set of instructions devoid of subtle, human communication, including seemingly infinite nuanced persuasion and non-verbal cues. The content of those computers – data – is a minified asset and hardly adequate to address all the variables involved in human decision-making. The only purpose for data in software design is to make clients and investors feel more comfortable about solutions that were somehow vetted by market research channeled through analytical processes. That is pandering to ignorance for the sake of money, perpetuating a fallacy of perception.

Computers are a work in progress and at least hundreds if not thousands of years from achieving our complexity. But they don't stand a chance of advancing to our level if we, the inventors, keep looking to them for the answers. Patterning our mental processes to mimic our computers – still relatively primitive tools in the scope of human evolution – is not only ironic, it's moronic.
