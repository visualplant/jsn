							<p>I'm very concerned about the future of design and technology post-Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>On the surface it would appear Jobs' influence has grown greater after his death. The praise has been lavish and universal; the same author who wrote biographies of Einstein and Ben Franklin just published one for Jobs. The former CEO of Apple has been exalted to near messiah-status. Take a look at some recent quotes:</p>

<pre><code>"Steve's innovation and creativity will inspire dreamers and thinkers for generations."
- Howard Stringer, CEO, Sony

"Steve's passion for simplicity and elegance leaves us all a legacy that will endure for generations."
- Stephen Elop, CEO, Nokia

"We're going to enter a golden age of design, just by virtue of thousands of founders and designers asking themselves, "What would Steve do?" The things that these people will create will be even bigger than Apple. That's part of his legacy."
- Matt Mullenweg, Founder, WordPress 
</code></pre>

<p>But Jobs himself said right before he died,</p>

<pre><code>"Don't ask, ‘what would I do.' Ask, ‘what is the right thing to do.'"
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, few know what is the right thing to do, and even fewer who might actually know, can also achieve it on a scale large enough to shape civilization.</p>

<p>In one sense, Jobs' genius is not genius at all. He was a generalist with a dearth of education in anything specific. Dropping in on a college typography class informed his pursuit of the modern GUI and resulted in the desktop publishing revolution. But I also took a typography course and it would've been no huge, mental leap for me to profess, "this stuff should be on computers." Or like Steve, travel to India, return and incorporate intuitive thinking in my work. The difference is execution.</p>

<p>No, Jobs did not design or program anything, but his taste, intellect and perseverance assembled teams that could appreciate his taste, confront his ego and implement the technology. Steve's role was far more involved than fishing ideas from heaven and force-feeding them to designers and engineers. He conceived, mentored, collaborated, managed, tested, argued and all-around crafted a maniacal, iterative process to arrive eventually at incredible creations. A unique combination of tasteful ideas, content and a no-compromises process was the genius.</p>

<p>And culture. Technologists are supposed to be content-agnostic. Jobs was not. With no regard for personal wealth and long before he convinced the world it was cool,  Jobs breathed content-culture into his company. Bob Dylan. The Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad and retail stores are all dripping with multi-national creative culture. Ghandi. Apple employees and, wishfully, we customers are "The crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels." Because culture is embedded in every product and every perfect package delivered by Apple, the products become the marketing. To use an iPad is partly a state-of-mind. He understood that the ambience of a restaurant changes the way the food tastes.  Jobs infused the ambience of culture in everything he touched.</p>

<p>And I'm afraid you can't replicate that so easily in technology. Nor improve upon it.</p>

<p>Here's the biggest misconception: Apple beat Microsoft, Dell, Google and every technology competitor to become the most valuable company in the world because its products were better. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Yes, more than anyone I believe Apple products are far-and-away superior. They speak the human dialect rather than forcing humans to speak computer. Their designs are an impeccable combination of the best materials and minimal features to simplify rather than complicate our lives. But 90% of consumers do not see or understand why any product is better or worse, can't discriminate a real Monet from a cheap knock-off artist, can't taste a good from a mediocre bottle of wine. They follow the masses and buy what their idols and friends do. Only Jobs' seminal distortion field could first influence the connectors, who would influence the mavens, who would influence the salesman, and finally reach the tipping point of the masses.</p>

<p>And only this once. This may be the only time in the history of industry that the best company with the best product has prevailed on a large scale. History has proven over and again that second- and third-rate products usually win. VHS beat Beta in the 80s. Microsoft beat Apple in the 90s.</p>

<p>A nearly unreproducible series of events resulted in an environment where Jobs could succeed. In 1997 Apple was 90 days from bankruptcy. Only the dire context of we-have-nothing-to-lose-and-everything-to-gain provided him the possibility to fire the entire board of directors and assume absolute, dictatorial control over Apple at a time when he had matured just enough to steer a large company on a progressive course. He would continue to do that, exercising his intuition, taste and said maniacal process for a bit more than decade. And it could've been for 2 decades more.</p>

<p>But that was cut short. There is no Steve Jobs at Apple or in the world anymore. And there are as few possibilities for a comparable man to find himself in such an ideal circumstance to influence change as there was the ideal environment for this one planet Earth to develop life and thrive in the harsh, cold vacuum of space. Look around. Have you seen another Earth out there recently?</p>

<p>I predict Apple will continue to copy and produce its own products and rake in the profits for years to come. The forthcoming "golden age of design" will be filled with charlatans and copy-cats. Android, Windows and other knock-offs may succeed once again.</p>

<p>I feel both saddened and also motivated to change this unfortunate likelihood.</p>
