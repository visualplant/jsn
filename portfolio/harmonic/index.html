					I joined <a href="http://www.harmonicinc.com" target="_blank">this video tech company</a> to help them transition their legacy hardware products to modern, cloud-native software, and in the process, solve what they perceived to be a straight-forward problem. They had over 50 different product user interfaces in their portfolio with non-intuitive workflows that mostly looked terrible. The UIs were inconsistent with each other, bound by no ecosystem and often overlapped in functionality&mdash;the cumulative effect of many product initiatives and acquisitions with various, questionable design standards.

					In a redesign it's counterproductive to fixate on the legacy product or simply apply lipstick to an aging pig. Instead, I take a step back to look at the market and users. A deep understanding of context would allow me to formulate a design strategy with workflows and aesthetics driven by purpose. The up front investment is well worth it, and later on, a great design flows from a thorough understanding of the problem, a grounded strategy and an execution rooted in an agile design process. While my process can be customized to each project based on the team, it generally follows the steps below.

					In the past, my employer's Product Managers would unquestioningly add ever customer-requested feature, exposing it to thousands of other users. This approach inevitably resulted in "death by a thousand cuts" and code bloat which further hampered agility. The lack of a truly probing discovery led to this dysfunctional dynamic; it needed to change before the product design could improve.
					<br /><br />
					My cyclical discovery consisted of a combination of internal interviews, competitor analysis, customer visits and review of legacy usage data. 	For onsite visits, I arrived with a simple plan: First, I asked a handful of broad questions, and listened attentively. Second, I passively observed users in their work environments. My direct exposure revealed something quite different from what I heard internally. Users were paralyzed with a maze of complexity in the products. And the disorganized UI was scaring them away to the competition.

					With a plethora of useful research documented, I collaborated with my managers to interpret it and formulate a product design plan. Naturally, this involved a lot of trial-and-error, so we quickly presented ideas on the white-board and captured them to a photo stream for subsequent review and discussion. Then, we filtered the best from the rest, and reached consensus to proceed.</div>

					 I gave more structure to our inchoate directions by developing semi-functional wireframes and umbrella schematics.

					It's exciting to bring ideas to fruition in the form of high-definition designs, but particularly on a platform of such ambitious scope, there's much more than aesthetics to deliver in this stage. It begins with a well-crafted interaction style guide, including behaviors comprised of custom components (Javascript) and look-and-feel elements comprised of stylistic classes (CSS) derived from the company brand. The result should support usability standards, incorporate the thought and planning invested in discovery and definition, express the company's personality and help maintain user experience continuity throughout every interaction in a large-scale, multi-app platform. It should also mean we don't need to reinvent the wheel every time a similar user interaction is needed on subsequent features.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					My style guide delivered clear documentation <i>and</i> client-tested front-end code customized specifically for the current needs and growth expectations of <i>our</i> product&mdash;VOS.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					The design deliverables were published as styles, components, patterns and lastly, a semi-functional high-def prototype to an internal Web portal (UXHub) with supporting code delivered in a version-controlled repository and reusable components stored in an Artifactory. The code included helpful comments, references to Confluence definition docs, and finally, epic JIRA tickets assigned to Scrum masters for task-delegation to individual developers. It made for a well-organized hand-off to the Engineering group to execute back-end integration, API development as well as detailing acceptance criteria for later quality assurance testing.

					A powerful, simple and delightful User Experience framed with a beautiful UI is purely academic unless developed to perform, scale and extend. To that end, some of my first and most important users to please are the developers. My deliverables to them need to be thorough, organized and motivate them to work many long hours toward the design goal I've proposed.  
					
					To assist them in their work, my process incorporates significant UI development as described in the Design stage, including browser and client unit testing.
					
					My team's up-front UI development allows back-end programmers to focus on the heavy-lifting of micro-service engineering, API development and integration. I do my job, so they can do theirs. During development, I'm available to answer questions, clarify direction, provide pseudo logic and offer insight on corner cases.

					To a designer, Production deployment is both fulfilling and nerve-racking. But despite conventional wisdom&mdash;that a designer's job is done at this moment&mdash;the journey has only completed its first cycle. In fact, deployment means it's time to discover again&mdash;this time to learn how the product performs in the real world and repeat the process. Whether it's myself, a member of my team or a torch passed to iterate the design, it's as important as the initial design itself.
					<br /><br />
					With VOS a fundamental principle I stipulated in the deployment strategy was that software design is never done. Users expect frequent updates, bug fixes and eventually, substantial upgrades. Continuous deployment is a hallmark of good product design.
					<br /><br />
					The information garnered to evaluate the product is crucial, and it comes from two categorical sources: <b>usage data</b> and <b>customer feedback</b>.
					<br /><br />
					Many 3rd parties offer great tools for <b>usage data</b> and it's essential to integrate one or more into the deployment and review usage patterns periodically.
					<br /><br />								
					 <b>Customer feedback</b> comes from many sources, including Sales Reps, trade shows, arranged meetings and, in the case of VOS, a customer Community Forum. The goal is not to solicit feature requests, but rather to listen, document and build customer goals into a thoughtful product roadmap, so we, the architects design the product for the customer and not the other way around. This approach is a win-win where business goals and customer needs align.

					I used virtually every bit of my past experience, skills, and admittedly some improvisation, to help conceive and bring the VOS platform to life. It was a daunting task at the outset, but a thoughtful approach and daily diligence has so far paid dividends in the form of industry recognition and, most importantly, engaged, paying customers. The evolution continues...
