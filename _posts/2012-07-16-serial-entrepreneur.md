If you refer to yourself as a "serial entrepreneur" …

… then, you are bragging that you start companies just for the game, to add another notch in your belt, because you're a "visionary" and too "high-level" to follow through on what you started. Replace "start companies" with "date people" and "kill people" in the last sentence and you can be a serial monogamist and serial killer too.

It's a foolish tact. Would you open a first date with: "I will date you briefly and then bail" or tell your girl/boyfriend: "I'm gonna love you forever,
until I change my mind." If you consider yourself a father of companies, then remember that only 1% of fatherhood is impregnation. The other 99% is the devotion of raising a child through thick and thin. Get with the program or be a dead-beat Dad.

Ok, so you're just not mature enough yet? Then, at least pretend your goal is to commit and create just one thing that matters. If you fail a few times, so be it. Success is elusive. But let someone else call you a serial entrepreneur. And if they do, be a little insulted.
