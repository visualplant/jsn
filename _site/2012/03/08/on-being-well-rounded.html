							<p>"Learn all the changes, then forget them." - Charlie Parker</p>

<p>I believe I've put in my 10,000 hours, and I've tried lots of academic approaches to user-centered design. My conclusion on what really makes you great in this field: being well-rounded.</p>

<p>I don't mean well-rounded in all the various academic, scientifically-derived UX methodologies. I mean being generally well-rounded with a smattering of exposure to as many disciplines and as much life experience as possible – from graphic to industrial design, to engineering, to writing, to marketing, to law, to philosophy, to psychology, to making music, film, comedy, art, food, to working in a large company, to doing a startup, to being a competitive athlete, to traveling, to trying drugs, to being involved in serious relationships. This kind of dabbling breaks the rule book dictated by the technology industry – that you must be focused, detail-oriented, collect and interpret data to dictate decisions on a product and iterate development based on user feedback – in essence, to acquire and process information like a computer. But in that rule book is a false assumption: that deconstructing success is the secret to creating it.</p>

<h2>Just create</h2>

<p>In college I minored in Music which taught me about the complex inner constructs of the works of masters, like J.S. Bach, Charlie Parker and Jimi Hendrix. Music theorists discovered patterns such as "key modulations" and "polymeters" to explain how and why great music was great. My music teachers then drilled it into to me, so I could compose music like the masters. But ask Bach, Parker and Hendrix about such patterns and they'd probably laugh. They didn't survey people to assess if their current listening habits would accept new sounds. They didn't write their music by consciously plotting key signatures and polyrhythms. They just went ahead and played it. They followed their ear and derived music from experience and emotion. Jimi's word for a theorist's augmented 4th interval was not "tritone". It was "Purple Haze". Great artists don't deconstruct to recreate. They just create. Same goes for digital product design.</p>

<h2>Don't ask for the answer, provide it</h2>

<p>When asked what kind of user research Apple does, Steve Jobs' reply was, "None. It isn't the consumers' job to know what they want." According to his biography, Jobs was a mediocre engineer and rambling dabbler who dropped out of college, dropped in on typography classes and took a pilgrimage to India. Then, how did he nail the best product idea and user experience design time and again? Not by belaboring academics, rather, by being well-rounded, emotionally-centered and intellectually astute. He roamed the earth and absorbed life. That was his user research. Then, he came home to synthesize that experience and pioneer products. In addition to being well-rounded himself, he insisted on recruiting brilliant team players from a wide variety of disciplines.</p>

<pre><code>"Part of what made the Macintosh great was that people working on it were musicians, poets, and artists, and zoologists, and historians." -Steve Jobs
</code></pre>

<p>With a product vision as the guiding purpose, the team then figured out how to build it. Purpose has a way with process.</p>

<h2>Human</h2>

<p>There is a gestalt to being human, and technology often seems oblivious to it. Because software design requirements are often born by technologists, the expectation is that design should track a linear process to determine needs. But creating a user experience for a technology product is NOT a narrow exercise in technology – it is a bridge that connects a core technology with humanity. And incorporating dozens of activities in one life for this purpose is a guiding principle. In the end it's a wide variety of backgrounds that inform a designer's ability to cater to a common psychology and then create a user experience that binds a world of users to a product. It's about being well-rounded and in tune which ironically makes it possible to be out of tune with the status quo and design something great.</p>
